These dots are not mine! You can access original dots from : https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland. 

This repo contains my PRs and tweaks to original dots. (mostly up to date with original dots). This is my current daily driver.
However there can (and will) be bugs **so don't expect stability here**. Use these dots if you know what you are doing.

Before saying “these dots are bloated,” keep in mind that there’s a toggle for everything.
